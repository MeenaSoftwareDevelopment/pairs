# Pairs

This is the code for the Pairs game, as part of the Software Development 1 course.

For project details, see [the project's README](https://github.com/MeenaSoftwareDevelopment/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md).

This README is unfinished, but so is the game. We're working on it.

We utilized Vite as a tool to set up and facilitate the development of our React-based Pairs game. The game logic, interface designs, and styles were created by us.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
```
